#summary A page dedicated to updating the group on the status of your current roles.

= Description =

I figured we could use this page to update the team on any updates, breakthroughs, or concerns related to our project. We can help each other through difficulties if everyone knows what each person is working on. Here is the division of labor again.

  * Aaron & Jason -> Program flow and behavior
  * Larry -> User Interface
  * Denis & Dustin -> Graphics, Animations, and Native Code development
