This should hopefully explain how to get doxygen working in Eclipse...

Download eclox from the page below and follow the install directions on that page.
http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/plugins/eclox-doxygen.html

There should be a little blue @ sign in the toolbar of eclipse now for building doxygen.

I have already created and committed a doxyfile that the doxygen build references. It outputs in the doxygen folder that i commited as well. To view the html documentation open index.html in menupp/doxygen/html.
